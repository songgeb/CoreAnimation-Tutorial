# App Architecture

Applications Are a Feedback Loop

1. Construction—Who constructs the model and the views and connects the two?
2. Updating the model—How are view actions handled?
3. Changing the view—How is model data applied to the view?
4. View state—How are navigation and other non-model state handled?
5. Testing—What testing strategies are used to achieve reasonable testcase code coverage?

The answers to these five questions form the basis of the application design patterns we’ll look at in this book.
